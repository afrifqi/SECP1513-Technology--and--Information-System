## Reflection 
---
> Attending the UTM Digital Open Day was a meaningful and eye-opening experience for me. Through the talks, exhibitions, and booth visits, I gained a better understanding of how digital technologies are applied in real-world systems and campus operations.
> 
> One of the highlights of the event was a knowledge-sharing session on Oracle technologies delivered by Encik Muhammad Asrul Muhammad Zain. During this session , he told that Oracle Academy provides student free access to structured curriculum development, learning resources, and hands-on access to practical tools related to databases such as Database Management Systems, Java, Cloud Services, Enterprise Technology and so on . As a result , students have the opportunity to utilise many of the same systems and to gain practical experience with them that align with current industry requirements.
>
> By attending the booths at the UTM Digital Open Day, I gained a better understanding of types of digital technologiesand systems used by various businesses. I also acquired knowledge of the most current technology trends and innovations with an emphasis on how technology projects can be created and employed.
